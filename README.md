## Getting started

I've used json-server to store jobs data. In order to start, you'll have to run two commands:

```
npm run start
npm run start-server
```

## Comments

- I've skipped prop types check (just to save some time)
- There are some comments about simplified version of container async testing
- No state management lib included (also to save time mostly)
